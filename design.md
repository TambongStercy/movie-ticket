Absolutely! Here’s how I’ll proceed, step by step, to help you redesign your Movie Ticket Booking System to match the modern, Netflix-inspired UI you provided, while keeping things simple and only including features relevant to your app.

## **Step 1: Analysis & Planning**

### **A. Core Design Elements to Adopt**
- **Dark theme** with accent colors (red, white, gray, yellow for ratings, etc.)
- **Sidebar navigation** for main sections (Home, Discover, Bookings, Profile, etc.)
- **Top navigation** for quick access (Movies, TV Shows, Anime, Search) — adapt to your app (e.g., Movies, Bookings, Profile)
- **Card/grid layout** for movies and bookings
- **Modern buttons** (rounded, colored, hover effects)
- **Consistent header/footer** with logo and user info
- **Use your custom logo** (`logo.jpg`) in the header/sidebar

### **B. Pages to Redesign**
#### **User Side**
1. **Login/Register (auth/)**
2. **User Dashboard (user/index.php)**
3. **Movie Details (user/movie_details.php)**
4. **Seat Selection (user/select_seats.php)**
5. **Booking Confirmation (user/booking_confirmation.php)**
6. **My Bookings (user/my_bookings.php)**
7. **Profile (user/profile.php)**
8. **Download Ticket (user/download_ticket.php)**
9. **Header/Footer (includes/header.php, includes/footer.php)**

#### **Admin Side**
1. **Admin Dashboard (admin/index.php)**
2. **Manage Movies (admin/manage_movies.php, add_movie.php, edit_movie.php)**
3. **Manage Theatres (admin/manage_theatres.php, add_theatre.php, edit_theatre.php)**
4. **Manage Showtimes (admin/manage_showtimes.php, add_showtime.php, edit_showtime.php)**
5. **View Bookings (admin/view_bookings.php)**
6. **User Management (admin/manage_users.php, add_user.php, edit_user.php)**
7. **Header/Footer (includes/header.php, includes/footer.php)**

### **C. Includes/Shared**
- **CSS:** Use Tailwind CSS (already present) + custom styles for sidebar, dark mode, etc.
- **JS:** For sidebar toggling, modals, etc. (minimal, only as needed)
- **Logo:** Use `logo.jpg` in sidebar/header

## **Step 2: Redesign Plan for Each Section**

### **1. Header/Footer**
- **Header:** Dark background, logo on left, navigation links (Movies, Bookings, Profile), user avatar/name on right.
- **Footer:** Simple, dark, copyright.

### **2. Sidebar (for dashboard pages)**
- **Sidebar:** Vertical, dark, logo at top, navigation links with icons, highlight active page.
- **Links:** Home, Discover (if needed), My Bookings, Profile, Logout (User); Dashboard, Manage Movies, Theatres, Showtimes, Users, Bookings, Logout (Admin).

### **3. Main Content**
- **Cards/Grids:** For movies, bookings, users, etc.
- **Buttons:** Red for primary actions, gray for secondary, rounded, hover effects.
- **Forms:** Dark backgrounds, white text, red/gray buttons.

### **4. Movie Cards**
- **Poster image, title, genre, rating, duration, Book/Details button.**
- **Hover effect for cards.**

### **5. Booking/Seat Selection**
- **Modern seat map (simple grid, colored for available/booked/selected).**
- **Summary card for booking details.**

### **6. Admin Pages**
- **Same sidebar/header/footer style.**
- **Tables for management, styled with dark theme.**
- **Action buttons (edit, delete) with icons.**

## **Step 3: Implementation Plan**

1. **Update `includes/header.php` and `footer.php`** for both user and admin to use the new layout, logo, and navigation.
2. **Create/Update a sidebar partial** (e.g., `includes/sidebar.php`) for user and admin dashboards.
3. **Update CSS:** Add custom styles for sidebar, cards, buttons, etc. (in `css/style.css`).
4. **Redesign each page** (user and admin) to use the new layout:
    - Wrap content in a flex container (sidebar + main content)
    - Use cards/grids for listings
    - Update forms and tables to match the dark theme
    - Use consistent buttons and icons
5. **Test responsiveness** (mobile/desktop).

## **Step 4: Next Steps**

**Would you like me to start by:**
- Showing you a sample header/sidebar/footer code for both user and admin?
- Or, do you want a full code update for a specific page first (e.g., user dashboard)?

**Let me know your preference, and I’ll proceed step by step, making sure you’re happy with each part before moving to the next.**

**Summary:**  
I will redesign all user and admin pages to match the Netflix-style UI, using your logo, and only including features relevant to your app. I’ll start with the shared includes (header, sidebar, footer), then update each page for both user and admin, keeping everything simple and beautiful.

**Please confirm if you want to start with the shared layout (header/sidebar/footer) or a specific page!**
